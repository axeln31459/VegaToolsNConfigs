Set up passwordless ssh on root account.
If you don't know how to do it, please google it, since it is beyound my scope.
Copy all the files in rigmonitor to VegaToolsNConfigs directory in each rig.
Edit rigList.txt file to reflect your rig ip address(es).
Run "rigMon.sh rigList.txt".

The rigMon.sh can be use for xmrig-amd and TeamRedMiner out of the box with default directories.
You may tailor it for other miners.

Note: If you use my default directories, no need to change the script(s).
Default for xmrig-amd - ~/git/xmrig-amd/build/
Default for TeamRedMiner - ~/git/teamred/
